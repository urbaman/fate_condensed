# Regole opzionali

Queste sono alcune regole opzionali o alternative che potete decidere di utilizzare nella vostra partita.

## Condizioni

Le **condizioni** sono un sostituto per le conseguenze, e le rimpiazzano interamente. Le condizioni servono a due scopi: sollevano un po' di pressione da giocatori e GM nel decidere al volo un aspetto ben scritto per una conseguenza inflitta, e offrono l'opportunità di dare forma alla natura della vostra partita definendo in anticipo i modi in cui i danni duraturi accadono ai personaggi.

La versione delle condizioni di _Fate Condensato_ prende ogni livello di condizione e lo separa in due condizioni di metà del valore.

**[1] Contuso** (Lieve) **[1] Spaventato** (Lieve)
**[2] Ferito** (Moderata) **[2] Scosso** (Moderata)
**[3] Lesionato** (Grave) **[3] Demoralizzato** (Grave)

Queste condizioni corrispondono agli stati fisici e mentali, ma solo per il fatto di aver subito un colpo fisico non significa che tu non possa segnare anche una condizione mentale, e vice versa, a patto che abbia senso. Gli attacchi sono traumatici!

Ci si riprende dalle condizioni proprio come dalle conseguenze, in base alla severità.

Se dovessi acquisire un'altro spazio di conseguenza lieve, ottieni invece altre due caselle di **Contuso** o **Spaventato**, come appropriato.

### Andare più lontano con le condizioni

Se voleste invece tenere le condizioni fisiche e mentali separate, raddoppiate il numero di caselle in ognuna. Detto questo, c'è un limite: se vengono segnate due caselle di un a condizione in una riga, nessun'altra casella può essere segnata sulla stessa riga. Quindi se hai una casella (di due) segnata su **Contuso** e nessuna su **Spaventato**, per poi segnare o la seconda di **Contuso** o la prima di **Spaventato**, non potresti più segnare altre caselle su quella riga.

Se dovessi acquisire uno spazio di conseguenza lieve (per un valore alto in Fisico o Volontà, o per un talento), aggiungi invece altre due caselle di **Contuso** o **Spaventato** secondo appropriatezza. Queste caselle aggiuntive aumentano la soglia limite per quella riga, uno per uno.

### Altre versioni delle condizioni

Vari giochi pubblicati basati su _Fate_ utilizzano le condizioni al posto delle conseguenze. Sentitevi liberi di adottare quelle implementazioni invece di quella presentata qui, se si adatta meglio al vostro gusto. Ognuna persegue lo stesso scopo per la partita: ridurre la pressione nel trovare aspetti di conseguenza al volo, e fornire una guida sulla natura della partita limitando i tipi di danno duraturo che i personaggi possono subire.

## Modificare l'elenco delle abilità

Come abbiamo detto in precedenza gli elenchi delle abilità sono la prima cosa da considerare per eventuali modifiche quando create la vostra partita a _Fate_. Il nostro elenco di base presenta un elenco di 19 abilità organizzate in una piramide di 10. Quell'elenco è strutturato anche intorno a un concetto tradizionale di capacità in vari campi d'azione, rispondendo di fatto alla domanda "cosa so fare?". Altri elenchi di abilità non devono per forza essere lunghi uguali, organizzati allo stesso modo, o rispondere alla stessa domanda. Detto questo, ecco alcuni elenchi di abilità corti da tenere in considerazione, mutuare e modificare.

* **Azioni:** Resistere, Combattere, Conoscere, Muoversi, Percepire, Pilotare, Intrufolarsi, Parlare, Armeggiare;
* **Approcci:** Attento, Ingegnoso, Appariscente, Energico, Rapido, Elusivo;
* **Attitudini:** Atletica, Combattimento, Leadership, Erudizione, Sotterfugio;
* **Attributi:** Forza, Destrezza, Robustezza, Intelligenza, Fascino;
* **Relazioni:** Guida, Collaborazione, Supporto, Solitario;
* **Ruoli:** Pilota, Picchiatore, Hacker, Meccanico, Truffatore, Ladro, Stratega;
* **Temi:** Aria, Fuoco, Metallo, Mente, Pietra, Vuoto, Acqua, Vento, Legno;
* **Valori:** Dovere, Gloria, Giustizia, Amore, Potere, Sicurezza, Verità, Vendetta.

Se volete un elenco più lungo, provate a iniziare dall'elenco di base, aggiungendo, combinando e rimuovendo abilità secondo necessità finché non arrivate dove volete. Potreste anche mescolare in qualche forma due o più abilità o più elenchi tra i precedenti.

**Avanzamento:** minore è il numero di abilità nel vostro elenco rispetto a quello di base, meno frequente vorrete l'acquisizione di punti abilità dall'avanzamento. Magari permetteteli solo durante i "potenziamenti", o limitateli in un'altro modo.

### Alternative alla piramide

* **Diamante:** un ampio centro (circa un terzo di esse) che si assottiglia verso l'alto e verso il basso dell'intervallo, per esempio 1 a +0, 2 a +1, 3 a +2, 2 a +3, 1 a +4;
* **Colonna:** all'incirca lo stesso numero di abilità valorizzate a ogni grado. Se l'elenco è abbastanza corto, potrebbe trattarsi di una linea, con un'abilità per gradino;
* **Libero con massimale:** fornisci ai abbastanza pnti abilità per creare una piramide (o un'altra forma) senza richiederla. Possono acquisire qualsiasi abilità, rimanendo sotto il massimale.

**Copertura:** assicurati di tenere presente quante abilità ti aspetti siano valorizzate rispetto al totale. L'elenco di base ha valori nel 53% (10 su 19) delle abilità. Maggiore la percentuale, maggiore la sovrapposizione che potranno avere i giocatori. Preserva la protezione degli ambiti specifici.

**Combinazione:** ptreste voler avere due elenchi di abilità, con i giocatori che ne sommano una da ogni elenco per aggiungerle ai propri tiri. La cosa principale da tenere presente è di mantenere i totali potenziali entro l'intervallo zero-massimale. Potreste avere intervalli da +0 a +2 in entrambi gli intervalli, o da -1 a +1 in uno e da +1 a +3 nell'altro, eccetera.

## Creazione del personaggio durante il gioco

Se un giocatore si trova a suo agio nel prendere decisioni creative al momento, potrebbe piacergli creare il personaggio mentre gioca piuttosto che prima di cominciare. Questo imita il modo in cui i personaggi si rivelano e si sviluppano pian piano in altri media. Non è per tutti, ma per gruppi per i quali il metodo scatta può essere di grande gradimento.

In questo metodo i personaggi cominciano soltanto col nome, un aspetto di concetto base e forse l'abilità più alta. Nel corso della partita, quando gli viene richiesto di utilizzare un'abilità non valorizzata, possono scegliere uno spazio vuoto e rivelare la propria competenza in quel momento. Allo stesso modo, gli aspetti e i talenti possono essere riempiti quando le circostanze lo richiedono, proprio nel momento in cui si spende un punto fato o si reclama un bonus.

## Conti alla rovescia

Un conto alla rovescia aggiunge urgenza a un avversario o situazione: affrontalo ora o le cose peggioreranno. Che si parli di una bomba che ticchetta, del completamento di un rituale, di un autobus che vacilla sul bordo di un ponte sospeso o di un soldato con una radio che sta per chiamare i rinforzi, i conti alla rovescia costringono i PG ad agire velocemente o ad affrontare conseguenze peggiori.

I conti alla rovescia hanno tre componenti: un indicatore di conto alla rovescia, una o più attivazioni e un esito.

L'**indicatore di conto alla rovescia** assomiglia a un indicatore di stress: si tratta di una riga di caselle che vengono segnate da sinistra a destra. Ogni volta che si segna una casella, il conto alla rovescia si avvicina a terminare. Pià corto l'indicatore, più rapidamente si approccia la sventra.

Un'**attivazione** è un evento che porta a segnare una casella sull'indicatore di conto alla rovescia. Può essere semplice quanto "passa un minuto/un'ora/un giorno/uno scambio" o specifico come "il cattivo subisce una conseguenza o viene messo fuori combattimento”.

Quando segli l'ultima casella, il conto alla rovescia termina e l'**esito** accade, qualsiasi cosa sia.

I GM potrebbero voler rivelare l'esistenza di un conto alla rovescia ai giocatori senza dirgli cosa rappresenta, almeno inizialmente, come presagio e per aumentare il sentimento di tensione nella storia.

Un conto alla rovescia può avere più di un'attivazione, se volete. Forse il conto alla rovescia procede con un certo ritmo finché non succede qualcosa che lo accelera. Potreste anche fornire un'attivazione diversa per ogni casella dell'indicatore di conto alla rovescia, se volete che sia una serie di eventi specifici a far scattare l'esito.

## Conseguenze estreme

Extreme consequences introduce an optional fourth severity of consequence to your game: something that permanently, irrevocably changes a character.

Taking an extreme consequence reduces stress taken by 8. When taken, you must replace one of your character’s existing aspects (other than their high concept, which is off-limits) with an aspect that represents the profound change to the character resulting from the harm they’ve taken.

By default, there is no option to recover from an extreme consequence. It has become a part of the character now. At your next breakthrough you may rename it to reflect how you’ve come to terms with it, but you can’t go back to the original aspect.

Between breakthroughs, a character may only use this option once.

Faster Contests
Some groups may feel contests involve too many attempts to create advantages per exchange. For those groups, try the following method: In each exchange of a contest, each participant may choose only one of these three options:

Make the overcome roll for their side (page XX).
Roll to create an advantage, but no teamwork bonus (page XX).
Provide their teamwork bonus to their side’s overcome roll or another’s attempt to create an advantage. Don’t roll.
Full Defense
Sometimes a player (or GM) may want their character to go all-in on using defend until their next turn, rather than taking an action on their turn. This is called full defense.

When declaring full defense, you must be clear about the focus of your efforts. By default, you are defending yourself (from attacks and efforts to create advantages on you), but you may wish to specify someone you’re protecting, or a defense against a particular group of aggressors, or a particular effort or outcome you wish to oppose.

While on full defense you get a +2 to all defend rolls relevant to your declared focus.

If nothing comes of it and you haven’t rolled to defend at all by the time your next turn comes around, you gain a boost (page XX) as you’ve gotten the opportunity to prepare for your next action. This offsets “losing a turn” because you focused your efforts on defending against something that didn’t happen at all.

Obstacles
The defining quality of enemies is that they can be attacked and taken out. By contrast, the defining quality of obstacles is that they can’t. Obstacles make scenes demonstrably more difficult on the PCs, but the PCs cannot simply fight them. Obstacles must be circumvented, endured, or rendered irrelevant.

While most obstacles are features of the environment, some might be characters that can’t be taken out using conventional methods. The dragon might be a boss, but it might just as easily be a hazard obstacle. The animate statue keeping you from getting to the evil wizard might be a threat, but it could also be a block or a distraction. It all depends on the adversary’s function in the scene, and how PCs must deal with it.

Obstacles don’t appear in every scene. They serve to accent enemies in the scene, to make them more threatening or memorable, but overuse of obstacles can be frustrating to the PCs, particularly those focused on combat. You can use them to give less combative PCs something to do during a fight, though.

There are three kinds of obstacles: hazards, blocks, and distractions.

Hazards
If an obstacle can attack the PCs, it’s a hazard. Fire jets, rolling boulders, or a sniper too far away to be dealt with directly—they’re all hazards. Every hazard has a name, a skill rating, and a Weapon rating (page XX) of 1 to 4.

The hazard’s name is both a skill and an aspect; that is, the name defines what the hazard can do, and its skill rating defines how good it is at doing that, but the name can also be invoked or compelled like any aspect.

Generally speaking, a hazard’s skill rating should be at least as high as the PCs’ highest skill rating, if not a little bit higher. A hazard with a very high skill rating and a very high Weapon rating will likely take out a PC or two. You could also make a hazard with a lower skill rating but a high Weapon rating, making for something that doesn’t hit often but hits hard when it does. Reversing that makes a hazard that hits frequently but doesn’t do much damage.

A hazard acts in the initiative just like the PCs and their enemies do. If your rules require everyone to roll for initiative, hazards will roll with their rating. On its turn each exchange, a hazard acts as implied by its name, and rolls with its rating. If it attacks and hits with a tie or better, add its Weapon rating to its shifts. Hazards can attack or create advantages; they can’t be attacked, and they don’t overcome obstacles.

If a player wants to overcome or create an advantage against a hazard, they’ll face passive opposition equal to the hazard's skill rating.

Blocks
Where hazards exist to hurt the PCs, blocks prevent them from doing things they want to do. Blocks can cause stress, though they don’t always. The chief differences between blocks and hazards is that blocks don’t take actions and are more difficult to remove. Blocks provide passive opposition in certain circumstances, and can threaten or cause harm if not heeded.

Like hazards, blocks have a name and a skill rating, and the name is both a skill and an aspect. Unlike hazards, a block’s skill rating shouldn’t be much higher than one step above the PCs’ highest skill rating; otherwise, things can get frustrating quickly. A block can have a Weapon rating as high as 4, but it doesn’t need to have one.

Blocks only come into play under specific circumstances. A Vat of Acid only matters when someone tries to cross it or gets thrown into it. A Chain Link Fence only affects someone who tries to get past it. The Animate Statue only prevents entry into a specific room.

Blocks don’t attack and don’t have a turn in the initiative order. Instead, whenever a block would interfere with someone’s action, they’ll have to roll against the block’s rating as a set difficulty. If the block can’t cause harm, it simply prevents the PC from taking the action they wanted to. If it can cause harm and the PC fails to overcome the block, the PC takes a hit equal to the amount by which they missed the target.

Characters may try to force someone into a block as an attack. If you do this, you’ll roll to attack as normal, but add a Weapon rating equal to half the block’s Weapon rating (rounded down, minimum 1).

Finally, some blocks can be used as cover or as armor. This is situational—for some blocks, it simply won’t make sense. You probably can’t hide behind a Vat of Acid, but a Chain Link Fence _is_ effective protection against a baseball bat, probably preventing the attack altogether.

When someone’s using a block as cover, decide whether it mitigates or negates the attack. If it negates it, the attack simply isn’t possible. If it mitigates it, the defender adds an Armor rating equal to half the block’s skill rating (rounded down, minimum 1).

Use blocks sparingly. Blocks make it harder for PCs to take certain actions—so they can be frustrating if you overuse them—but they can also lead the players to think creatively. They may see an opportunity to turn blocks to their advantage. If they figure out how, let them!

Sometimes players will just want to remove blocks outright. To do so, make an overcome roll against a set difficulty equal to the block’s rating plus two.

Distractions
Where hazards attack the PCs directly and blocks prevent them from taking certain actions, distractions force the PCs to figure out their priorities. Of the obstacles, distractions are often the least mechanically defined. They also don’t necessarily make the scene mechanically harder. Rather, they present the PCs with difficult decisions. Here are the distraction’s parts:

A distraction’s name is a brief, punchy representation of what it is. It can be an aspect, if you need or want it to be.
A distraction’s choice is a simple question that codifies the decision it gives to the PCs.
A distraction’s repercussion is what happens to the PCs if they don’t deal with the distraction. Some distractions might have multiple repercussions, including repercussions for successfully dealing with the distraction.
A distraction’s opposition is its passive opposition against PCs rolling to deal with it. Not every distraction needs to provide opposition.
If you’re afraid the PCs will deal handily with a fight you’ve got in store, adding a distraction or two can force them to decide whether it’s more important to trounce the bad guys or deal with the distractions.

Dealing with a distraction should always have a clear benefit or, failing that, not dealing with a distraction should always have a clear consequence.

Examples of Obstacles

Hazards

Great (+4) Machine-Gun Turret, Weapon:3
Superb (+5) Distant Sniper, Weapon:4
Blocks

Fair (+2) Chain Link Fence, Great (+4) difficulty to remove
Good (+3) Vat of Acid, Weapon:4, Superb (+5) difficulty to remove
Distractions

Bus Full of Civilians—Choice: Will the bus plunge off the bridge? Opposition: Good (+3) Repercussion (leave them): All of the civilians on the bus die. Repercussion (save them): The villain gets away!
The Glittering Gem—Choice: Can you take the gem from the pedestal? Repercussion (leave the gem): You don’t get the (priceless) gem. Repercussion (take the gem): You activate the traps in the temple.
Scale
Scale is an optional subsystem that you can use to represent supernatural beings which operate on a level beyond the general range of capabilities of most characters in your game. Usually you don’t need to worry about the impact of scale within your game. There may be times, however, where it’s desirable to present the characters with a threat bigger than they typically face—or an opportunity for the characters to punch outside their usual weight class.

As an example—you may wish to change the list to something more suitable to your setting—we’ll present you with five potential levels of scale: Mundane, Supernatural, Otherworldly, Legendary, and Godlike.

Mundane represents characters without access to supernatural power or technologies that would boost them beyond the capabilities of humans.
Supernatural represents characters who do have access to supernatural powers or technologies reaching beyond human capacity but who are still effectively human at the core.
Otherworldly represents unusual or unique characters whose powers set them apart from the normal concerns of humanity.
Legendary represents powerful spirits, entities, and alien beings to whom humanity is more of a curiosity than a threat.
Godlike represents the universe’s mightiest forces: archangels, gods, faerie queens, living planets, and so on.
When applying scale to two opposing forces or individuals, compare the sides’ levels and determine who is higher, and by how many levels. They get one of the following benefits on any rolled action against their lesser:

+1 per level of difference to their action before the roll
+2 per level of difference to the result after the roll, if the roll succeeds
1 additional free invoke per level of difference to the results of a successful create advantage action
Frequent and rigid application of scale rules may put player characters at a distinct disadvantage. Compensate by generously affording those players opportunities to subvert scale disadvantage in clever ways. Viable options include researching a target for weaknesses, changing the venue to one where scale doesn’t apply, or altering goals so that their opponent cannot leverage their scale advantage.

Aspects and Scale
Active situation aspects sometimes represent a supernatural effect. In these cases, the GM may determine that invoking the aspect grants the additional benefit of its scale. Furthermore, a supernaturally created aspect may grant scale to some actions when invoked. It may also provide scale even without an invoke, such as in the case of a magical veil or high-tech camouflage suit; you need not invoke Veiled to gain Supernatural scale when sneaking about.

Does Scale Apply When Supernaturally Creating an Advantage?
If you are creating an advantage and there is no opposition, rather than rolling you simply gain the aspect with one free invoke. That aspect grants scale as previously described.

If you are creating the advantage on someone else to their detriment, such as casting Entangled by Animated Vines on your foe, you may gain scale on your effort to create the advantage.

If you are creating an advantage via supernatural means and an opposing party can directly impede the effort via physical or supernatural interference, your scale may apply against their defend roll.

Otherwise, you roll to create the advantage without scale (likely against a set difficulty), but later use of that aspect grants scale when appropriate.

Time Shifts
When determining how long it takes characters to do something, you may want to use a more systematic approach to decide the impacts of success, failure, and “at a cost” options. How much longer or faster? Let the shifts decide, using these guidelines.

First, decide how long the task takes with a simple success. Use an approximate quantity plus a unit of time: “a few days,” “half a minute,” “several weeks,” and so on. Approximate quantities for use include: half, about one, a few, or several of a given unit of time.

Then look at how many shifts the roll exceeds or misses the target by. Each shift is worth one quantity-step from wherever your starting point is.

So if your starting point is “a few hours,” then one shift faster jumps the quantity down to “about one hour,” two shifts down to “half an hour.” Going faster than “half” drops the unit down to the next smaller (hours to minutes, etc) and quantity up to “several”, so three shifts faster would be “several minutes.”

In the case of slower, it’s the same process in the opposite direction: one shift slower is “several hours,” two is “half a day,” three is “about one day.”

Ways to Break the Rules for Big Bads
Between combining skills and creating advantages for teamwork (page XX), a group of PCs can really overwhelm a single opponent. This is fine if you want to respect the advantage of numbers, but not great if you want to present a “big bad” that’s the equal of the whole group.

But remember, for monsters and other big threats it’s acceptable to break the rules (page XX)—so do so by looking at ways to counteract the group’s usual advantage of numbers, while still giving them a chance. Here are a few suggestions for ways you might do that. You can use one or more of these in combination for especially difficult or terrifying final bosses.

Challenge or Contest Immunity
Both of these methods are about drawing out the final confrontation by running the group through a clock-is-ticking-down activity before they can actually go after the big bad directly.

With challenge immunity, your big bad cannot be affected directly (mentally, physically, or both) until the group beats a challenge (e.g., dismantling the source of its power, figuring out what its weakness is, etc). The big bad, meanwhile, can act freely and may attack them during their efforts, oppose their overcome or create advantage efforts with its defend rolls, assail their free invokes with its own overcomes, or prepare for their eventual breakthrough by creating advantages of its own.

With contest immunity, the group must win a contest to be able to directly attack the big bad—and the big bad gets to attack them while they’re trying. If the big bad wins the contest, it gets to pull off its scheme and get away unscathed.

Expendable Minion Armor
Surrounding yourself with minions is one way to try to balance a big bad’s side against the PCs, but it only goes so far if the players can just decide to go after the big bad directly and ignore those pesky minions for a while.

But with expendable minion armor in play, a big bad may always succeed at a cost on its defend rolls against attacks by forcing a minion into the path of the attack. That minion doesn’t roll to defend, they just take the hit that would have landed on the big bad otherwise. This forces the PCs to chew through the big bad’s army before the final confrontation.

And remember, minions don’t have to be literal minions. For example, you might write up one or more “shield generators”, each one with a stress track and perhaps a skill for creating defensive advantages for the shielded big bad!

Reveal True Form
Okay, the group has thrown everything they’ve got at the big bad, and—awesome!—they just took him out. There’s just one problem: that just frees him from his cage of flesh to reveal his true form!

With reveal true form, your big bad isn’t just one character, it’s at least two characters which must be beaten sequentially, each one revealing new capabilities and stunts, higher skill ratings, fresh stress and consequence tracks, and even new “rule breaks.”

If you want to gentle this a bit, carry the consequences the big bad has already taken forward between forms, dismissing the mild ones and downgrading the moderate and severe ones by one step each.

Scale Things Up
You could scale things up to let your big bad operate at a higher scale than the PCs, using the scale option from page XX. You could do this even if scale isn’t normally in play in your campaign—these rules need only apply when a big bad takes the field!

Solo Bonus
Players may enjoy a teamwork bonus, sure—but why not give your big bad a complementary solo bonus when they’re the only one facing the heroes?

There are a few ways you could implement a solo bonus. You could use more than one of these, but be careful when combining them as they’ll add up fast.

The big bad gets a bonus to skill rolls that’s equal to the group’s maximum potential teamwork bonus (page XX) — the number of PCs acting against the big bad minus one (so a +2 vs a group of 3, etc). This bonus can’t do better than double the big bad’s affected skill, though, just as with PCs (or maybe you’ll break _that_rule too).
The big bad may reduce the stress of successful attacks by the number of opposing PCs divided by two, rounded up. If you’re worried this will make the fight run too long, then hits reduced this way can’t be reduced below 1.
The big bad has amplified invokes: when making a paid invoke of an aspect, their bonus is equal to the number of PCs they face. No such luck with free invokes, but this makes every fate point spent utterly terrifying.
The big bad may suppress invokes: when facing two or more foes, the opposition’s invokes only provide a +1 bonus, or allow rerolls only, when used directly against the big bad. Optionally, the big bad might also remove the PCs’ ability to stack free invokes.
The Threat is a Map (or a Hive of Characters)
In Fate, anything can be a character, so why not a map? When the threat is a map, your big bad has zones (page XX) which must be navigated to achieve victory.

As you detail your big bad map, each zone might have its own skills, aspects, and stress capacity. Some zones might contain simple challenges that must be overcome in order to move deeper into the creature. Each zone may take an action as a separate character against PCs occupying that zone, or in the case of a zone representing a limb or similar, may be able to attack adjacent zones as well. If a zone is taken out by one of the PC’s attacks, it may be bypassed and no longer gets to take actions of its own, but the overall big bad isn’t defeated until the heroes can reach its heart and kill it true.

This method works particularly well if your big bad is a truly gigantic monster, but need not be limited to that situation. You can use the idea of treating the threat as a collection of interconnected characters, without requiring that the PCs actually enter or navigate the big bad as a literal map. Used this way, you’ve got a hybrid between a map and expendable minion armor (page XX)—a hive of characters, after a fashion. Some parts of the big bad must be defeated before the players can hit where it is truly vulnerable, and those parts get to take their own actions in the exchange.

Whether you fully engage the map idea or simply build the big bad as a hive, you’re sure to end up with a more dynamic fight where the big bad acts more frequently, and the players must figure out a plan of attack that eliminates the threat piece by piece before they can finally put it down.

Ways to Handle Multiple Targets
Inevitably, someone at your table will want to affect multiple targets at once. If it’s allowed, here are some methods you can use.

If you wish to be selective about your targets, you may split your effort. Roll your skill, and if the resulting total is positive, you can split that total up however you like among the targets, who each get to defend against the effort you assigned to them. You must assign at least one point of effort to a target, or you didn’t target them at all.

Sophie faces a trio of goons and wants to strike at all three in a flurry of thrusts with her rapier. Thanks to an invoke and a good roll, her Fight roll comes in at Epic (+7). She assigns a Good (+3) attack to the one that looks the most veteran, and Fair (+2) to each of the other two, for a total of seven. They each then roll to defend.

In some special circumstances, as with an explosion or similar, you may make a zone attack against everyone in one zone, friend and foe alike. Here, you don't split your effort; every target must defend against your total roll. The circumstances and method must be right for doing this; often the GM will require you to invoke an aspect or use a stunt to gain permission.

If you wish to create an advantage affecting a whole zone or group, target the scene instead: place a single aspect on the zone or the scene itself rather than placing separate aspects on each of the targets. This has the added advantage of reducing overall book-keeping. If someone insists on creating a separate aspect on each target, they should be constrained to the effort splitting method.

With any of these methods, all of the targets should occupy the same zone. The GM may allow the occasional exception due to method and circumstance.

Only one action type should be used—such as attacking several targets in one blow, solving two problems at once with overcome, or swaying the minds of a few key NPCs with create an advantage. A GM might allow two different action types under special circumstances, but those actions should make sense for the skill used by both.

Weapon and Armor Ratings
Want to tap into a little bit of that combat equipment vibe other games have? Consider weapon and armor ratings. In short, getting hit by a weapon will damage you more, and having armor keeps that from happening. (You could model this with stunts, but using stunt slots might not feel right to you.)

A weapon value adds to the shift value of a successful hit. If you have Weapon:2, it means that any hit inflicts 2 more shifts than normal. This counts for ties; you inflict stress on a tie instead of getting a boost.

An armor value reduces the shifts of a successful hit. So, Armor:2 makes any hit worth 2 less than usual. If you hit but the target’s Armor reduces the attack’s shifts to 0 or below, you get a boost to use on your target but don’t do any harm.

Choose your range of ratings carefully. Keep an eye on how likely they make a consequence (or worse) on a tie. We recommend a range of 0 to 4 at most.
