# Essere il Game Master

Come GM, sei il direttore delle sessioni di gioco. Nota che non sei il capo. _Fate Condensato_ è collaborativo, e i giocatori hanno parola in ciò che succede ai propri personaggi. Il tuo lavoro è quello di tenere le cose in movimento facendo queste cose:

* **Gestire le scene**: una sessione è costituita di scene. Decidi dove inizia la scena, chi è presente e cosa sta succedendo. Decidi quando tutte le cose interessanti sono state giocate e la scena è finita. Salta le cose superflue; per lo stesso motivo per cui non tiri i dadi se il risultato di un'azione non è interessante, non proporre una scena se durante la stessa non succederà nulla di eccitante, drammatico, utile o divertente;
* **Giudicare le regole**: quando saltano fuori domande riguardanti l'applicazione delle regole, puoi discuterne con i giocatori e provare a raggiungere un consenso, ma hai l'ultima parola;
**Impostare le difficoltà**: decidi quando serve un tiro di dadi e impostane le difficoltà;
* **Determinare i costi del fallimento**: quando un personaggio fallisce il proprio tiro, decidi tu quale sia il costo per il successo con un costo. Puoi certamente accettare suggerimenti dai giocatori (possono sapere come vogliono che si faccia del male il loro personaggio), ma la decisione è tua;
* **Interpretare i PNG**: ogni giocatore controlla il proprio personaggio, ma tu controlli tutto il resto, dai cultisti ai mostri fino al Cattivone stesso;
* **Fronire ai PG opportunità per l'azione**: se i giocatori non sanno cosa fare come prossima mossa, è tua responsabilità fornirgli una spintarella. Non lasciare mai che le cose si impantanino nell'indecisione o nella mancanza di informazioni: fai qualcosa per scuotere le cose. Quando hai dei dubbi, pensa a come le tattiche e gli obiettivi del Cattivone possono creare un problema per gli eroi;
* **Assicurarsi che tutti abbiano la ribalta**: il tuo obiettivo non è sconfiggere i giocatori, ma sfidarli. Assicurati che ogni PG abbia la sua possibilità di essere il protagonista per un po'. Distribuisci tentazioni e sfide su misura per le diverse abilità e debolezze dei personaggi;
* **Complicare le vite dei PG**: in aggiunta a lanciare mostri in faccia ai personaggi, sarai la sorgente principale delle tentazioni. I giocatori possono tentare sé stessi e altri personaggi, certamente, ma tu devi assicurarti che tutti ottengano l'opportunità di vivere le ripercussioni negative dei loro aspetti;
* **Costruire sulle scelte dei giocatori**: guarda alle azioni che i PG hanno fatto durante il gioco e pensa a come il mondo cambia e risponde. Fai che il mondo venga percepito come vivo presentando ai PG quelle conseguenze in gioco, positive e negative.

## Impostare le difficoltà e l'opposizione

Sometimes, a PC’s action will face opposition via a defend roll from another character in the scene. In this case, the opposing character rolls dice and adds their relevant skill rating, just like the PC. If the opposing character has relevant aspects, they can be invoked; the GM can invoke NPCs’ aspects using the fate point in their pool (page XX).

But if there’s no opposition, you have to decide on the difficulty of the action:

* Low difficulties, below the PC’s relevant skill rating, are best when you want to give them a chance to show off.
* Moderate difficulties, near the PC’s relevant skill rating, are best when you want to provide tension but not overwhelm them.
* High difficulties, much higher than the PC’s relevant skill rating, are best when you want to emphasize how dire or unusual the circumstances are and make them pull out all the stops, or put them in a position where they will need to suffer the consequences of failure.

Likewise, use the adjective ladder (page XX) of ratings to help you choose an appropriate difficulty. Is it superbly difficult? Then pick Superb (+5)! Here are a few rules of thumb to get you started.

If the task isn’t very tough at all, make it Mediocre (+0)—or just tell the player they succeed without a roll, as long as there’s no serious time pressure or the character has an aspect that suggests they’d be good at it.

If you can think of at least one reason why the task is tough, pick Fair (+2); for every extra factor working against them, add another +2 to the difficulty.

When thinking about those factors, consult what aspects are in play. When something is important enough to be made an aspect, it should get a little attention here. Since aspects are true (page XX), they might have influence over how easy or difficult something should be. That doesn’t mean that aspects are the only factors to consider, of course! Darkness is darkness regardless of whether or not you decided to make it an aspect on the scene.

If the task is impossibly difficult, go as high as you think makes sense. The PC will need to drop some fate points and get lots of help to succeed, but that’s fine.

For an expanded look at what you can do to create varied and interesting opposition and adversaries for your players, check out the Fate Adversary Toolkit, [available for sale as a PDF](https://www.dreamlord.it/prodotto/fate-strumenti-del-sistema/) or with its essentials [freely available in the online system reference documents](https://www.fateitalia.it/capitolo-1-introduzione-perche-siamo-qui/).

## NPCs

NPCs include bystanders, supporting cast, allies, foes, monsters, and pretty much anything else that might complicate or oppose the efforts of the PCs. You will probably want to create other characters for the PCs to interact with.

### Major NPCs

If someone is particularly important to the story, you can stat them out just like a PC. This is appropriate for someone who the PCs will deal with a lot, such as an ally, a rival, the representative of a powerful group, or a Big Bad.

A major NPC doesn’t necessarily follow the same limits as a starting PC. If the NPC is going to be a recurring boss-level threat, give them a higher peak skill (see Setting Difficulty and Opposition on page XX), more stunts, and whatever else it takes to make them a danger.

### Minor NPCs

NPCs that aren’t going to be major, recurring characters don’t need to be nearly as well-defined as major NPCs. For a minor NPC, only define what is absolutely necessary.

Most minor NPCs will have a single aspect, which is just what they are: Guard Dog, Obstructive Bureaucrat, or Enraged Cultist, etc.

If necessary, give them another aspect or two to reflect something interesting about them or a weakness. They may also have a stunt.

Give them one or two skills to describe what they’re good at. You can use skills from the skill list or make up something more specific, like Fair (+2) at Getting into Bar Fights or Great (+4) at Biting People.

Give them zero to three stress boxes; the more they have, the more of a threat they can be. Generally, they have no consequence slots; if they take a hit with more shifts than they can absorb with stress, they are simply taken out. Minor NPCs aren’t meant to stick around.

### Monsters, Big Bads, and Other Threats

Like minor NPCs, monsters and other threats (like a storm, a spreading fire, or a squad of armored minions) are written up as characters, but are usually simpler than a PC. You only need to define what is absolutely necessary. Unlike minor NPCs, these threats can be defined really in any way. Break the rules. Give them whatever combination of aspects, skills, stunts, stress, and consequences it will take to make them dangerous, and think about what sort of difficulties they will present to the PCs when determining their ratings.

## Your Fate Points

At the start of each scene, begin with a pool of fate points equal to the number of PCs. If the scene includes a major NPC or monster that conceded (page XX) a previous conflict, or received hostile invokes (page XX) in a previous scene, those fate points are added to your pool. If you received a compel in the prior scene that ended that scene, giving you no opportunity to spend the earned fate point, you may add that point to your pool as well.

Charles, Ruth, Cassandra, and Ethan are headed for the final confrontation with Alice Westforth. Previously, she escaped from the heroes by conceding a conflict after she had taken a moderate consequence. That means the GM gets four fate points for the PCs and two more that Alice is bringing along.

As the GM, you can spend fate points from this pool to invoke aspects, refuse compels that the players offer NPCs, and use any NPC stunts that require you to—all exactly as the players do.

However, you do not need to spend fate points to compel any aspects. You have an infinite supply of fate points for that purpose.

## Safety Tools

GMs (and truly, players as well) have a responsibility to ensure that everyone at the table feels safe in the game and space they’re playing. One way a GM can support this is by offering a framework for anyone at the table to voice a concern or objection. When this happens, it must take priority and must be addressed. Here are some tools that can help make that process more available to the players at the table and more easy to enact when necessary.

* **[The X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg):** The X-Card is an optional tool (created by John Stavropoulos) that allows anyone in your game (including you) to edit out any content anyone is uncomfortable with as you play.
* **[Script Change RPG Toolbox](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m):** For something with a bit more nuance and granularity, look to Script Change by Brie Beau Sheldon, which provides options to pause, rewind, skip ahead, and more using an accessibly familiar media-player metaphor.

Tools like these may also be used like the bogus rule (page XX) for calibration. They offer a way for players to comfortably advocate for what they’re looking for in the game. Give such tools the respect and support they deserve!
